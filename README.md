This is a working demo of asynchronous communication between a flask backend and a react frontend.

To start:
./startserver.sh

(in a different terminal)
cd client
npm start

Things to note
- The flask server runs on port 5555
- In order to keep versions of EngineIO compatible.
(client) version of socket.io-client: 2.3.0
(server) version of flask_socketio: 4.3.2
